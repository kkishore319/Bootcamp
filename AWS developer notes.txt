1. EC2 instance storage:

EBS: 
elastic block store volume is a network drive attaches to instances.
persist data even after their termination and can be mounted to one instace (ccp) but at developer level multi attach feature is there.
locked to one az if want to move use snapshot
to use we need to provide the capacity like GBs and IOPS

by default if rooted EBS is deleted on termination where other attached EBS vols are not deleted.

EBS Snapshots:
Backup for EBS , is incremental backup , can copy across az or region 
features: 
1. EBS Snapshot Archive: archive tier(75% cheaper) takes 24-72 hrs to restore
2. Recycle Bin: recycle bin for accidental deletion and retention is 1day-1yr
3. Fast Snapshot Restore(FSR): force full initialization of snapshot for no latency on first use(expensive)

AMI(Amazon Machine Image):
customization of ec2 instance, can add our software, config., OS, monitoring.,etc. Faster boot/config. time because all software is pre-packaged.
built for specific region( copied across regions)
launch ec2 intances from public AMI, our own AMI , our AWS Marketplace AMI

process: start ec2 and customize, stop instance(for data integrity), Build an AMI(creates snapshots), launches instances from other AMIs

EC2 instance store:
high-performance hardware disk, better I/O performance, if instance is stopped they will loss their storage, use as buffer/cache/scratch data/temporary content, risk of data loss if hardware fails, backups and replication are our responsiblility.

EBS Volume types(6 types):
--------------------------------------
GP ( general purpose SSD volume balances price and perf.) 
-cost effective, low latency 
-1 GiB - 16 TiB
-system boot vols, virtual desktops, dev and test envs

1. gp2(SSD): 
small gp2 vol can burst IOPS to 3,000,
size of vol and IOPS are linked, max is 16,000
3 IOPS per GB, means 5,334 GB we are at max IOPS

2. gp3(SSD): 
baseline 3,000 IOPS and throughput 125 MiB/s
can increase 16,000 IOPS and throughput upto 1000 MiB/s independently
---------------------------------
Provisioned IOPS(PIOPS)(highest perf. SSD vol for mission critical low latency or high throughput workloads)
-apps that need more than 16000 IOPS
- great for database workloads (sensitive to storage perf and consistency)

3. io 1:(4GiB - 16 TiB)
max PIOPS 64,000 for nitro instances and 32,000 for other
increase PIOPS independently,more durability and more IOPS per GiB

4. io 2:( 4 GiB - 64 TiB)
sub-millisecond latency 
max PIOPS 256,000 with IOPS:GiB is 1,000:1
-----------------------------------------------------
(Low cost HDD )
can't be used for boot vol
125 GiB - 16 TiB

5. st 1:(frequently accessed) throughput optimized 
Big data, data warehouses, log processing 
max throughput 500 MiB/s, max IOPS 500

6. sc 1: (less freq. accessed) Cold HDD
lowest cost
max throughput 250 MiB/s, max IOPS 250
--------------------------------------------
EBS Multi-Attach :
for only provisioned iops family io1,io2
attach same EBS vol to multiple ec2 instances in same AZ
each instance has full read& write permissions to high-perf. vol
use case: achieve high application availability in clustered linux apps(eg: teradata)
	applications must manage concurrent write ops.
upto 16 instances only at a time	
file system must be cluster-aware (not XFS, EXT4)


Amazon EFS- Elastic File System
Managed NFS (network file system) can be mounted to many eC2
EFS works with instances in multi-AZ
highly available, scalable , expensive(3x gp2), pay per use
use cases: content management , web serving, data sharing, Wordpress
uses interanl NFSv4 protocol
uses security grp to control access to EFS
compatible with linux based AMIs(not windows)
POSIX file system(linux) that has std file API

EFS scale: 1000s of concurrent NFS client, 10 GB+/s throughput
grow petabyte scale nfs automatically 

performance Mode(set at EFS creation time)
general purpose(default): latency sensitive use cases (webservers, CMS etc)
max I/O-higher latency,throughput,highly parallel(bigdata,media processing)

throughput Mode:
Bursting: 1 TB= 50 MiB/s + burst of 100 MiB/s
Provisioned: set throughput regardless storage size(eg:1 GiB/s for 1 Tb storage)
Elastic:  automatically scales up and down based on workloads
upto 3 GiB/s for reads and 1 GiB/s for write 
used for unpredictable workloads

EFS- storage classes
storage Tiers ( lifecycle management feature- move file after N days)
std : for freq. access
infreq access (EFS-IA): cost to retrieve files, lower price to store, enable EFS-IA with lifecycle policy

availability and durability:
std: multi az, great for prod
one zone : one Az, grear for dev, back enabled by default, compatible with IA(EFS One Zone-IA) 
90% in cost savings


EBS vs EFS 

EBS: one instance at time( except io1& io2)
locked at az level, gp2: increases IO if disk size increases, gp3: IO can increased independently
to migrate across az: need snapshots and restore at respective az , don't backup while application is handling lot of traffic.

EFS: mounted to 100s of instances across az, EFS share website files (wordpress), only for linux instances, costly than EBS, can leverage EFS-IA for cost savingsf

2. AWS Fundamentals: ELB+ASG

scalability: by adapting the application can handle greater loads
a. vertical scalability(increase size)
for non distributed systems like databases like RDS , ElastiCache can scale verically 

b. horizontal scalability(increase number)(elasticity)
for distributed systems, common web apps/modern apps

High Availability
having application at least 2 Azs, to survive a data center loss, can be passive for RDS Multi-Az and active for horizontal scaling

Load balancing:
servers that forward traffic to multiple servers downstream

ELB(Elastic Load Balancer):
managed load balancer, aws takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability and few config. knobs
if we have our own LB but it will cost less but will be alot more effort on our end
it's integrated with many aws services like ec2, ASG, ECS, ACM,CloudWatch, Route 53, WAF,AWS Global Accelerator

Health Checks:(crucial for Load balancers)
enable LB to know if instances it forwards traffic to are available to reply to request and it's done on a port and route 

Types of load balancers
Classic LB: old generation-2009: HTTP,HTTPS,TCP,SSL(Secure TCP)
Application LB: new -2016: HTTP,HTTPS,WebSocket
Network LB:new-2017: TCP, TLS(secure TCP), UDP
Gateway LB:2020:Operates at layer 3 (network)- IP protocol

Application Load Balancer (ALB) layer 7(HTTP)
-load balancing to multiple HTTP apps across machines(target grps)
-load balancing to multiple apps on the same machine (eg:containers)
-support for HTTP/2 and WebSocket
-support redirects ( from HTTP to HTTPS for eg)

Routing tables to diff target grps:
routing based on : 
	-path in url(example.com/users & example.com/posts)
	-hostname in url (one.example.com & other.example.com)
	-Query String,Headers (example.com/users?id=123&order=false)
ALB are great fit for microservices & container-based apps (docker & ECS)
has port mapping feature to redirect to a dynamic port in ECS

ALB target grps:
ec2 instances ( managed by ASG) -HTTP
ECS tasks( managed by ECS itself)- HTTP
lambda fns - HTTP req is translated into JSON event 
IP Address-must be private IP's 
ALB can route to multi target grps
Health checks are at target grp level

while connecting through ALB from client to instance
client Ip can't be known by instance instead its knows ip which is private ip fo ALB
if want know the ip of client it will look into extra headers in HTTP req which are port and proto (x-forward-for)
