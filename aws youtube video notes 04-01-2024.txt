Let's create an app(normal way) // 
-first need private network// VPC
-a webserver to run code via vms with disks // EC2 & EBS
- users may use it via IP // ROUTE53
- to extend the application by adding bussines logic we need app server with vms // EC2
- also relational database is also required coz we have for diff servers // RDS
- need horizontal scaling so add LB // AUTO SCALING & ELB
- need DNS for domain name // ROUTE 53
- add noSql db for meta data and connections// DYNAMODB
- add cache Db for read same data // ELASTICCACHE
- for media files , we need external storage // S3
- content filter can also be added if needed // REKOGNITION ML
- click stream analysis( to read and show what we click like show approp. ads) for this we also need another storage // KINESIS & S3
- add spark/hadoop for data operations like aggregation and sorting // EMR
- add data warehouse ( BI like features data analytics like trending things etc  ) // REDSHIFT
- we can link external storage to users via WEB BROWSER // S3
- for mobile ( different devices ) we need other external storages by video converter // LAMBDA for converter & S3.
-we need CDN for cacheing the videos so it will have low latency to connect media // CLOUDFRONT EDGE LOCATIONS 
- for notifications we need SMS and email services // SQS, SNS 
- for messaging we need mq services//
- for monitoring we need ETL service // GLUE
- for monitoring dashboard on the services // CLOUDWATCH

extra services in AWS
- we can have API GATEWAY for rest API 
- for ...congnito
- for security services we can have IAM  , KMS (encryption),
- ACM(amazon certificate manager to secure the communication)
-  WAF for application protection at ips and cdns
- for compliance (free from vulnalerability) INSPECTOR
- for development & devops services we have cloudformation 
- codecommit to have repo of code for diff teams 
- to build the code from codecommit we have codeBuild 
- after testing we can deploy by codeDeploy
- with codepipline we can pipeline all code... once
